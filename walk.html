      <p>cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under<br>
        <p>Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.  </p>               
    </li>

<p><li><b>1941</b>  -  Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br>
  <p>rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT<br>
    <p>to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.  </p>               
</li>

<p> <li><b>1942</b>  - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li></p>

<p><li><b>1944</b>  -  Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br>
    <p>pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br>
      <p>Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br>
    <p>resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth. </p>               
  </li>

  <p> <li><b>1945</b>  - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li></p>

  <p><li><b>1953</b>  -  crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br>
    <p>American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to<br>
      <p>provide 95% of Mexico's wheat. </p> 
</li>

<p><li><b>1962</b>  -  Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian<br>
    <p>subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly<br>
      <p>expanding population </p>
    </li>

    <p> <li><b>1970</b>  - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li></p>

        <p><li><b>2005</b>  - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues<br>
            <p>that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as<br>
              <p>we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous<br>
            <p>because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long<br>
            <p>time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds." </p>  
 </li>

 <p> <li><b>2009</b>  - dies at the age of 95.</li></p>
